              The liquify module offers a versatile way of moving pixels around by applying free
              style distortions to parts of the image. There are three tools to help doing that:
              points, lines, and curves.

    <para>
      Each of liquify's tools is based on nodes. A point is given by a single node, a line or a
      curve consist of a set of nodes defining the path.
    </para>

    <para>
      There is a limit of 100 nodes in a single liquify instance. For more distortions one can
      use multiple instances of the liquify module. However, take into account that the liquify
      module requires a lot of computing resources.

    <para>
      You can drag the central point of a node to move the node around. The radius describes the
      area of the applied effect: the distortion occurs only inside this radius. To change the
      radius drag the handle at the circumference. A strength vector starting from the center
      describes the direction of the distortion, and its strength is depicted by the length of
      the vector. You change the vector by dragging its arrowhead.

        A point is formed by a single node. In a point the strength vector has three different
        modes which are toggled using Ctrl+click over the arrowhead of the strength vector:
