                A <emphasis>3D LUT</emphasis> is a tridimensional table which allows for
                the transforming any RGB value into another RGB value, normally used for film
                simulation and color grading.
              </para>
              <para>
                The module accepts <emphasis>.cube</emphasis> and <emphasis>.png (haldclut)</emphasis> files.
                The 3D LUT data are not saved in database nor in the XMP file, only the 3D LUT file path
                inside the 3D LUT folder is saved (see below).

    <para>
      The module lut3d needs to find the 3D LUT file at the same place in your 3D LUT folder
      to calculate the output image.
      This means you have to backup properly your 3D LUT folder.
      Sharing an image with its XMP is useless if the recipient doesn't have the same 3D LUT file
      in his 3D LUT folder.

    <title>Usage</title>

    <sect5>
      <title>file selection</title>
      <para>
        File selection is inactive as long as the 3D LUT folder (where you have stored your LUT files)
        is not defined in <emphasis>3D LUT root folder</emphasis> under
        <emphasis>preferences/core options/miscellaneous</emphasis>.
      </para>
    </sect5>

    <sect5>
      <title>application color space</title>
      <para>
        A 3D LUT is relative to a specific color space. You have to select the one for which it has been built.
        Cube files are usually related to <emphasis>REC.709</emphasis> while most of others are
        related to <emphasis>sRGB</emphasis>.
      </para>
    </sect5>

    <sect5>
      <title>interpolation</title>
      <para>
        The interpolation method defines how to calculate output colors when input colors are not exactly on a node
        of the RGB cube (described by the 3D LUT).
        There are three interpolation methods available: <emphasis>tetrahedral</emphasis> (the default one),
        <emphasis>trilinear</emphasis> and <emphasis>pyramid</emphasis>.
        Usually you won't see any difference between the interpolation methods except with small size LUTs.
