    Almost all darktable modules have the option to narrow down their effect by a drawn mask and
    thus allowing local adjustments.

    <title>Overview</title>

    <para>
      With the drawn mask feature you can construct a mask by drawing directly on the image
      base. Different drawing operators, called shapes, are available and can be used alone or
      in combination. A flexible editing feature allows you to change single aspects of a shape,
      remove shapes or import shapes already defined in other modules.
    </para>

    <para>
      Internally shapes are stored as vector graphics and rendered with the needed resolution
      during pixelpipe processing. Shapes are expressed in the coordinate system of the original
      image and transformed with all distorting modules. This way a shape will always work on
      the same image area regardless of warping or other modifications that may be applied.

              To draw a shape you need to click on one of the shape symbols. You will

              the selected shape and afterwards change its properties.

      You leave edit mode by clicking on the

      symbol. You can at any time go back to edit mode and do further adjustments by clicking
      the edit symbol again. In edit mode you can also remove a shape by right-clicking on
      it&nbsp;&ndash; the shape is removed from the current mask but it's still in the list of
      defined shapes.

    <para>
      Independent of the specific shape you can <emphasis>scroll</emphasis> to change the size

      If you <emphasis>Ctrl+click</emphasis> on the edit mode symbol you enter a restricted edit

        Clicking the

        symbol adds a brush stroke.
      </para>
      <para>
        Start drawing by <emphasis>left-clicking</emphasis> into the canvas and moving the mouse
        while keeping the button pressed. The brush stroke is finalized once you release the
        mouse button. Brush size, hardness and opacity can be changed by
        <emphasis>scrolling</emphasis>, <emphasis>shift+scrolling</emphasis>, and
        <emphasis>Ctrl+scrolling</emphasis>, respectively, either before you start drawing or at
        any time during the operation. Likewise you can use keys
        <emphasis>[&nbsp;|&nbsp;]</emphasis> to decrease/increase brush size,
        <emphasis>{&nbsp;|&nbsp;}</emphasis> to decrease/increase hardness, and
        <emphasis>&lt;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&gt;</emphasis> to decrease/increase opacity.
      </para>
      <para>
        If you have a graphics tablet with pen pressure sensitivity, darktable can apply the
        recorded pen pressure to certain attributes of the brush stroke. See
        <xref linkend="gui_options"/> for more details.
      </para>
      <para>
        On lifting the tablet pen or releasing the left mouse button the drawn figure is
        converted into a number of connected nodes which define the shape. A configuration
        option (see <xref linkend="gui_options"/>) controls how much smoothing is applied. A
        higher level of smoothing leads to less nodes&nbsp;&ndash; this eases subsequent editing
        at the expense of a lower initial accuracy.
      </para>
      <para>
        Nodes and segments of a brush stroke can be modified individually. See the documentation
        on <emphasis>path</emphasis> below for more details.
      </para>
      <para>
        Rendering a complex brush shape can consume a significant number of CPU cycles; consider
        to revert to the circle, ellipse or path shape if possible.

        In the edit mode you can convert existing nodes from smooth to sharp corners and vice

        remove the whole path.

        The size of the complete shape can be modified by

        which can be changed by <emphasis>Shift+scroll</emphasis> from anywhere within the shape.
        Single nodes as well as path segments can be moved by mouse <emphasis>dragging</emphasis>.
        If a node is selected by <emphasis>clicking</emphasis> on it, a further control point
        appears&nbsp;&ndash; you can move it around to modify the curvature of the line and
        reset to default by <emphasis>right-clicking</emphasis>. <emphasis>Dragging</emphasis>
        one of the control points on the border adjusts the border width just in that part of
