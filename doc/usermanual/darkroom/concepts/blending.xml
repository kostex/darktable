    <title>Overview</title>

    <para>
      By default a module takes its input from the preceding module, performs its calculations
      and handles its output over to the next module in the pixelpipe. On demand you can
      activate an additional step where a module's output is reprocessed with its input before
      giving the result to the next module. This additional processing step is called blending.
      Input and output can be processed with different algorithms, called blending operators or
      blend modes.
    </para>

    <para>
      Each blend mode is further controlled by a parameter called opacity, which can have a
      value between 0% and 100% and defines how input and output image contribute to the final
      result. Typically an opacity value of 0% gives as a result an image that is identical to
      the input image&nbsp;&ndash; the module remains without effect. An opacity value of 100%
      delivers the maximum effect of the module with the blend mode chosen.
    </para>

    <para>
      The opacity value can be the same for all image pixels. In this case blending acts
      uniformily on the image. Alternatively you can make opacity values to vary between
      different image locations or pixel values. This is called a mask and gives fine control
      over what parts of an image are affected by a module and to what extent. At your choice
      you may activate a drawn mask or a parametric mask or a combination of both.

        Blending is activated with this combobox. Depending on the value selected additional
        control elements will show up.

        <para>
          module's output is passed to the next module in pixelpipe without additional
          reprocessing. No further controls are displayed.

        <para>
          reprocessing takes place with the chosen blend mode and opacity value&nbsp;&ndash; the
          same for all pixels. Additional controls to select blend mode and opacity value are
          displayed. The default blend mode is <quote>normal</quote> with an opacity of 100%.

        <para>
          reprocessing takes place with the chosen blend mode and opacity. Additional controls
          are displayed which allow you to draw a mask. If no mask elements are drawn all pixels
          have the same opacity, defined by the opacity slider. If you draw a mask element, e.g.
          a circle, the inner area of the circle will get maximum opacity, surrounded by a
          transition area or border with a gradual decay of opacity and the remaining image with
          an opacity of 0%. Different graphical shapes can be used. See
          <xref linkend="drawn_mask"/> for further details.

        <para>
          reprocessing takes place with the chosen blend mode and opacity. Additional controls
          are displayed which allow you to adjust the opacity on a per-pixel basis determined by
          pixel values. In previous versions of darktable this was called <quote>conditional
          blending</quote>. See <xref linkend="parametric_mask"/> for further details.

                When blending operators were introduced into darktable, a new module named
                <emphasis>highpass</emphasis> (see <xref linkend="highpass"/>) was added. It
                provides a highpass filter of the image to be implicitly used with blending. It
                is used to produce a gritty detailed image and is a method widely used in the
                workflow of other imaging software.
