    <title>Overview</title>

    <para>
      Map view will show you a world map with the currently open image, or film roll of images,
      pinned to their geotagged location. This requires that the image was geotagged by a camera
      with that feature. Some newer cameras, including smartphones, are already equipped with
      GPS receivers. Other cameras may need additional GPS hardware to do this.
    </para>

    <para>
      Even if your camera doesn't support this feature, there is an alternative method.
      darktable can match the Exif time and date data in your image(s) to a separate GPX data
      tracking file created by a GPS tracker recording your movements. These can be handheld
      devices or a GPS tracker app on your smartphone. This is all done in the lighttable view
      (see <xref linkend="geotagging"/>).

      <para>
        Map data are taken from open map sources on the internet. New map data are only
        available if you are connected to the internet. darktable keeps a disk cache of
        previously loaded map data.
      </para>

      <para>
        Your mouse will allow navigation in the map. Left-click will drag the map; using the
        scroll-wheel will zoom in or out.
      </para>

      <para>
        There are on-screen controls and displays that assist you to find your way. A navigation
        area is located on top left of the map. Use it as an alternative to mouse-dragging and
        scrolling. The scale of your map is displayed on bottom left. On bottom right you see
        the geographical coordinates for the center of the map.
      </para>

      <para>
        Images that already have geo location attributes in their metadata are displayed as
        small icons on the map.
      </para>

      <para>
        In order to assign geo coordinates to an image, activate the film-strip on the lower
        panel (press <emphasis>Ctrl+F</emphasis>). You can simply assign a geo location to an
        image by dragging the image icon from the film-strip and position it onto the map.
        darktable will record the new geo location (longitude and latitude) as part of the image
        metadata. Exported images will include this data.
      </para>

      <para>
        In order to remove geo coordinates from an image just drag it from the map and drop it
        onto the filmstrip.
      </para>

      <para>
        Left and right to the central map there are panels for additional control.

      <para>
        All image moves in the map view are recorded by darktable. It is then possible to undo
        or redo such changes to recover a previous state. Note that this undo/redo facility is
        unlimited while moving images but it is reset each time the map view is left.
