  <para>
    This menu gives you an overview of the presets that are defined for darktable's modules. In
    this dialog you can select whether a certain user defined preset shall be auto-applied to
    matching images. By pressing the <quote>import</quote> button at the bottom of the window
    you can import a saved preset.
  </para>

  <para>
    darktable already comes with a set of pre-defined presets for several modules. In addition
    you can define your own presets from within each module in darkroom mode (see
    <xref linkend="module_presets"/>).
  </para>

  <para>
    Pre-defined presets are shown with a lock symbol. Their auto-apply properties can not be
    changed.
  </para>

  <para>
    Double clicking on a user-defined preset will open a menu. This allows editing the preset
    or saving it to an external .dtpreset file.
