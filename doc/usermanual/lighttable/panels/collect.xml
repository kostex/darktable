            The current view in lighttable is called a collection. The <emphasis>collect
            images</emphasis> panel lets you narrow down the list of visible images to just the
            ones you want to work with.

  <para>
    Information about all images imported into darktable are kept in a database, with various
    attributes describing each image. You define a collection by applying certain filtering
    rules to these attributes, creating a subset of images to display in the lighttable view.
  </para>

  <para>
    The default collection is based on the film roll attribute&nbsp;&ndash; it displays all
    images of the last imported film roll or any other film roll chosen.

      <para>
        In the text field to the right of the attribute, you write a pattern. The pattern is
        compared against all database entries with the selected attribute. This search detects a
        match if the images' attribute contains the pattern in its full text. You may use
        <emphasis>%</emphasis> as wildcard character. The collection gets limited to those
        images where the query matches. Leaving the text field empty matches all images for that
        attribute.
      </para>

      <para>
        Attributes with numerical values as well as date and time attributes can be used in
        combination with comparative and range operators. Write <emphasis>&lt;</emphasis>,
        <emphasis>&lt;=</emphasis>, <emphasis>&gt;</emphasis>, <emphasis>&gt;=</emphasis>,
        <emphasis>&lt;&gt;</emphasis>, and <emphasis>=</emphasis> to select images with
        attributes less, less or equal, greater, greater or equal, not equal, or equal to the a
        given value, respectively. An expression in the form <emphasis>[from;to]</emphasis>
        selects a range of values.
      </para>

      <para>
        The box below the search rule will list all matching database entries of the query you
        are currently working on. This list gets updated continuously as you type. You may also
        choose sorting criteria by scrolling through the list and double-clicking (or single-click
        if you have set the option in preferences. See <xref linkend="gui_options_lighttable"/>).
      </para>

      <para>
        If you have set single-click mode, you'll be able to select range of values with mouse.
        This only works for numerical and date-time attributes.

        Clicking on the triangle button to the right of the text field opens a drop-down menu

        While it is best to not touch imported files behind darktable's back, this module can
        help you recover from situations when you move imported folders after import. The
        collect images module has a feature that allows you to tell darktable about the new
        location of imported folders which have been moved. You set the combobox to
        <emphasis>folders</emphasis> to find the original folder name in the tree. The folder
        name will be displayed striked-out to emphasize that it is no longer there. Then you
        right-click on the folder name, select <quote>search filmroll...</quote>, and then
        select the new location of the folder.
