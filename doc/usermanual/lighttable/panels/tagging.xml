                This panel is for managing tags on images. Tags are stored in both sidecar files
                (.xmp) and within the darktable database for a faster access. The panel is divided
                into two parts: the upper part contains the tag(s) currently attached to the image
                under the cursor or the selected image(s) if the mouse is outside the lighttable.
                The lower part contains a list of all available tags in the database, the dictionary, which can be
                filtered in the text box above.
              </para>
              <para>
                The list of available tags can be displayed in three different manners:

                  <listitem><para>
                    A flat list of tags

    </informaltable>

    <para>
      The goal of tags is to add information to the images within a given keyword set.
      But when the number of tags becomes large it is interesting to organize them in a hierachical manner, as a tree.
      The parent tags may not add information to the image, for example the tag <quote>color</quote>
      in <quote>color|white</quote>. In this case <quote>color</quote> will automatically
      seen as <quote>category</quote> if it is not in the dictionary itself. If exist as a tag, it can be set
      explicitly as a <quote>category</quote> (see create or edit command).
    </para>

    <sect4 id="tagging_tag_properties">

      <title>tag properties</title>

      <para>
        Besides its name the tag can set as private or as a category.
        It can also be attached synonyms.
        These attributes help to control the information you join to exported images.
        These information are related to <quote>XMP-dc Subject</quote> and
        <quote>XMP-lr Hierarchical Subject</quote> metadata.
      </para>

      <para>
        A tag set as <quote>private</quote> is by default not exported. The configuration point
        "force exportation of private tags" allows you to keep private tags on exported images.
        Both <quote>XMP-dc Subject</quote> and <quote>XMP-lr Hierarchical Subject</quote> are affected.
      </para>

      <para>
        A tag set as <quote>category</quote> is not exported in <quote>XMP-dc Subject</quote>.
        However it is exported in <quote>XMP-lr Hierarchical Subject</quote> as this XMP metadata
        holds the organization of your tags.
      </para>

      <para>
        <quote>synonyms</quote> enriches the tag information and is mainly destined to search engines.
        For example <quote>juvenile</quote>, <quote>kid</quote> or <quote>youth</quote>
        can be set as synonyms of <quote>child</quote>.
        An other usage is to translate the tag in other languages.
        The configuration point "request exportation of synonyms", when set, makes the image exportation
        add synonyms to <quote>XMP-dc Subject</quote> metadata.

        All the views have the following characteristics:
      </para>

      <para>
        On the left there is an indicator giving the status of the tag in relation with the selected images.
        A <quote>check-mark</quote> means the tag is attached to all selected images.
        A <quote>minus</quote> means that the tag is attached at least to one selected image.
        On tree view, on the parent node, it means that at least one child tag is attached to
        a selected image.
      </para>

      <para>
        On the right the count of images attached to the tag, in the database for dictionary view or
        among the selected images for attached view.

      <para>
        An <emphasis>italic</emphasis> tag is considered as a category. A category is a tag which helps
        to organize the tags but doesn't bring information to the image. A category is not exported.

        The text entry box, between the two lists, has multiple purposes.
      </para>

      <para>
        First, for those who like not to leave the keyboard, when the dictionary view is in list mode,
        as soon as you start to enter a keyword, it opens a list of corresponding tags.
        When you see the one you look for, use the <quote>down</quote> arrow
        to highlight it, press twice <quote>enter</quote> to get the tag attached !
      </para>

      <para>
        Those for who this procedure is not convenient can deactivate this function using
        the configuration "disable the entry completion".
      </para>

      <para>
        Besides this, the entry box lets you filter the dictionary (list and tree) just below searching
        amongst the tag names but also the synonyms.
      </para>

      <para>
        Pressing enter, either the tag just written does not exist in the dictionary.
        In such a case the new tag is added to the dictionary and attached to the selected images.
        Or it is already in the dictionary and it's only attached.
      </para>

      <para>
        You can use the submenu <quote>copy to entry</quote> to copy an existing tag
        from the dictionary into the entry box.
        Then you can modify it to create a new tag without having
        to type it in completely.

      <para>
        On import of a text file. You can import whatever text file as soon as it follows
        the lightroom tagging file format. It is possible to import several files.
        It is also possible to export your tags, add information in it and re-import it.
        As long as you don't change the tag name, the import function updates the existing
        tags with new information and create the new ones.
      </para>

      <para>
        On import of already tagged images. This is not a well controlled way especially
        if your dictionary is hierarchical.

        Note that the tag is also attached to selected images.
      </para>

      <para>
        As you may notice there are automatically created tags like <quote>darktable|exported</quote>
        or <quote>darktable|styles|your style</quote>, which keep track of your
        actions and let you easily find already exported images or images with specific styles
