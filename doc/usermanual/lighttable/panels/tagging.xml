            This panel is for managing tags on images. Tags are stored in both sidecar files
            (.xmp) and within the darktable database for a faster access. The panel is divided
            into two parts: the upper part contains the tag(s) currently attached to the image
            under the cursor or the selected image(s) if the mouse is outside the lighttable.
            The lower part contains a list of all available tags in the database, which can be
            filtered in the text box above.

  <para>
    New tags get added to the list either by typing into the text box and pressing the
    <quote>new</quote> button, or if an automatically generated tag gets attached to an image,
    or on import of already tagged images. darktable sorts the list of tags by relevance and
    frequency of usage.
  </para>

  <para>
    Hierarchical tags are supported and can be created using the pipe symbol <quote>|</quote>.
  </para>

  <para>
    As you may notice there are automatically created tags like <quote>darktable|
    exported</quote> or <quote>darktable|styles|your style</quote>, which keep track of your
    actions and let you easily find already exported images or images with specific styles
    applied.
  </para>

  <para>
    <emphasis> Tip: ctrl-t opens a small text box at the bottom of the central view for quickly
    tagging your selected images by typing a tag phrase and hitting return. </emphasis>

      <para>
        Delete a tag from the list and from all images. A warning will be displayed on how many
        images have this tag attached. Take this warning seriously as there is no way to recover
        or later find the affected images.
