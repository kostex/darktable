    <para>
      Most changes in the lighttable are recorded and can be
      reverted. This includes modifications to color labels, ratings,
      geo-localization, tags, metadata, copy/paste of history, or
      applying a style.  Thanks to this recording, it is possible to
      undo changes or redo them to recover a previous state. Note that
      this undo/redo facility is unlimited in the number of steps
      while in the lighttable, but it is reset each time the view is
      switched (going to the darkroom for example).
