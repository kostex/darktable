To build darktable for Windows operating system you have two basic option:
A) Native compile using MSYS
B) Cross compile on Linux

A) Native compile using MSYS2:  How to make a darktable windows installer (64 bit only):

    Install MSYS2 (instructions and prerequisites can be found on official website: https://msys2.github.io/).
    Update the base MSYS2 system until no further updates are available using:
	$ pacman -Syu

    From MSYS2 terminal, install x64 developer tools and x86_64 toolchain and git from the MSYS2 prompt:
	$ pacman -S base-devel
	$ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-{toolchain,cmake,nsis}
	$ pacman -S git

    Install required libraries and dependencies:
	$ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-{exiv2,lcms2,lensfun,dbus-glib,openexr,sqlite3,libxslt,libsoup,libwebp,libsecret,lua,graphicsmagick,openjpeg2,gtk3,pugixml,libexif,osm-gps-map,libgphoto2,flickcurl,drmingw,gettext,python3,iso-codes,python3-jsonschema,python3-setuptools}

    For gphoto2:
    You need to restart the MINGW64 or MSYS terminal to have CAMLIBS and IOLIBS environment variables  properly set for LIBGPHOTO are available. You can check them with:
	$ echo $CAMLIBS
	$ echo $IOLIBS

   	NOTE: at the moment, the lensfun version provided by MSYS2 (0.3.95-1) is broken. If you get errors in the build process, manually downgrade lensfun to version 0.3.2-4:
    Download the file mingw-w64-x86_64-lensfun-0.3.2-4-any.pkg.tar.xz from http://repo.msys2.org/mingw/x86_64/
    Put the file in your MSYS2 home folder, then from MSYS2 terminal:
    $ pacman -U mingw-w64-x86_64-lensfun-0.3.2-4-any.pkg.tar.xz
    Also in order to prevent pacman from updating the lensfun package, open the file /etc/pacman.conf, find the line: 
	#Pacman wonâ€™t upgrade packages listed in IgnorePkg and members of IgnoreGroup
    and below, add the following line
	IgnorePkg = mingw-w64-x86_64-lensfun
    Copy the lensfun folder and the lensfun-0.3.2-py3.6.egg-info file from /mingw64/lib/python3.6/site-packages to /mingw64/lib/python3.7/site-packages.
	
	From MINGW64 terminal, update your lensfun database:
	$ lensfun-update-data

    Also use this program to install USB driver on Windows for your camera:
    http://zadig.akeo.ie/
    When you run it, replace current Windows camera driver with WinUSB driver

    For usermanual
	$ pacman -S po4a
	$ pacman -S gnome-doc-utils
	$ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-{imagemagick,docbook-xsl}
	$ pacman -S libxml2-python

    Make sure you have JAVA runtime installed in Windows (https://www.java.com/en/download/)
    
	Manually install SAXON: https://sourceforge.net/projects/saxon/files/Saxon-HE/
    Copy files into ~/java/saxon/

    Manually install DocBook Extension to Saxon: 
	Download the file docbook-xsl-saxon-1.00.zip from https://sourceforge.net/projects/docbook/files/docbook-xsl-saxon/1.00/
    Open the file, go in the folder docbook-xsl-saxon-1.00
	Copy files to ~/java/docbook-xsl-saxon

    Manually install FOP: http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/xmlgraphics/fop
    Download the latest binary zip file
	Open the file, go in the folder fop<x.x>/fop
	Copy files to ~/java/fop
    Copy fop.xconf to /etc/fop.xml
    change one line in fop shell script in fop folder:
    from:
    if [ "$OS" = "Windows_NT" ] ; then
    to:
    if [ "$OS" = "Windows_NT" ] && [ "$MSYSTEM" != "MINGW64" ] ; then

    Modify your bash_profile file in your HOME directory and add the following lines:
    # Added as per http://wiki.gimp.org/wiki/Hacking:Building/Windows
    export PREFIX="/mingw64"
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$PREFIX/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"

    # This can be different depending on your current JAVA version
    JAVA_HOME="/C/Program Files (x86)/Java/jre1.8.0_101"
    export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin

    # Update your CLASSPATH
    CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:~/java/saxon/saxon9he.jar:~/java/docbook-xsl-saxon/saxon65.jar
    export CLASSPATH
    export SAXON_INSTALL_DIR=~

    # Update your PATH for fop
    PATH=$PATH:~/java/fop

    Execute the following command to actviate profile changes
	$ . .bash_profile

    From MINGW64 terminal, clone darktable git repository (in this example into ~/darktable):
        $ cd ~
        $ git clone git://github.com/darktable-org/darktable.git
        $ cd darktable
        $ git submodule init
        $ git submodule update

    Finally build and install darktable:
        $ mkdir build
        $ cd build
        $ cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/darktable ../.
        $ cmake --build .
        $ cmake --build . --target install

    After this darktable will be installed in /opt/darktable directory and can be started by typing /opt/darktable/bin/darktable.exe in MSYS2 MINGW64 terminal.

    For building the usermanual either add -DBUILD_USERMANUAL=ON flag to the first cmake command line, or if you want to build only the usermanual (and not the application) use:
        $ cmake --build . --target usermanual

    For building the installer image, which will  create darktable-<VERSION>.exe installer in current build directory, use:
        $ cmake --build . --target package
	NOTE: The package created will be optimized for the machine on which it has been built, but it could not run on other PCs with different hardware or different Windows version. If you want to create a "generic" package, change the first cmake command line as follows:
		$ cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/darktable -DBINARY_PACKAGE_BUILD=ON ../.
	

B) Cross compile on Linux
    In order to build darktable for Windows there is a chance to cross compile it
    on Linux. The result is currently not particularly usable, but still, if you
    are curious you could give it a try.

    The tests have been done cross compiling on openSUSE. Since it's using a
    virtualized installation only used for this stuff you can safely do everything
    as root. It's also enough to install a server setup without X.

    - Grab the openSUSE install ISO from http://software.opensuse.org/122/en
    (I used the 64 Bit version).
    - Install in Virtualbox.
    - Prepare the system:

    ------------------ snip ------------------
    #!/bin/sh

    # add the cross compiling repositoryies
    # regular stuff
    zypper ar http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/windows:/mingw:/win64/openSUSE_12.2/windows:mingw:win64.repo
    # extra repository for exiv2 and lensfun
    zypper ar http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/sergeyopensuse:/branches:/windows:/mingw:/win64/openSUSE_12.2/home:sergeyopensuse:branches:windows:mingw:win64.repo

    # install the needed tools like cross compilers
    zypper install bash-completion mingw64-cross-gcc mingw64-cross-gcc-c++ cmake binutils git libxslt

    # install the cross compiled libraries

                mingw64-libcurl-devel mingw64-libjpeg mingw64-libjpeg-devel \
                mingw64-libtiff mingw64-libtiff-devel mingw64-liblcms2 \
                mingw64-liblcms2-devel mingw64-libopenjpeg1 mingw64-libopenjpeg-devel \
                mingw64-GraphicsMagick mingw64-GraphicsMagick-devel mingw64-libexpat \
                mingw64-libexpat-devel mingw64-libsoup mingw64-libsoup-devel

    # the jpeg headers installed by openSUSE contain some definitions that hurt us so we have to patch these.
    # this is super ugly and needs to be redone whenever the library is updated.
    sed -e 's:^#define PACKAGE:// #define PACKAGE:g' -i /usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/sys-root/mingw/include/jconfig.h

    ------------------ snap ------------------

    - Put the sources somewhere, probably by grabbing them from git:
        git clone https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable.git
    - cd into the freshly cloned source tree and edit cmake/toolchain_mingw64.cmake if needed,
    it should be ok if using the virtualized openSUSE environment as described here.
    - Build darktable using this script (save it as build-win.sh). Make sure to edit it
    to suit your environment, too, if needed. Again, if following these directions it
    should be working out of the box. Run the script from the root directory of
    the git clone (i.e., put it next to build.sh):

    ------------------ snip ------------------

    if [ $? = 0 ]; then

    fi

    ------------------ snap ------------------

    - Last but not least:
    cd build-win; make install
    - Now you have a Windows version of darktable in /opt/darktable-win/, which
    should be suited for 64 bit Windows installations. Before you can run it do
        cp /usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/sys-root/mingw/bin/*.dll /opt/darktable-win/bin/
    - Done. Copy /opt/darktable-win/ to a Windows box, go to the bin folder and
    double click darktable.exe.

    KNOWN ISSUES:

    - The current working directory has to be the bin folder when running the .exe.
    Double clicking in Explorer does that for you.
    - GTK engine is not copied over/found currently, probably just a matter of putting
    the right DLLs into the correct places and/or setting some environment variables.
    We also want "wimp" in gtkrc instead of clearlooks. You can find it in
    /usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/sys-root/mingw/lib/gtk-2.0/2.10.0/engines/
    - A stupid error message about missing dbus symbols in a DLL. This is fixed in libglib
    already but the version used by us doesn't have it. Using newer openSUSE releases
    might fix this but I couldn't find lensfun and libexiv2 for them. Some day we might
    add our own build service to OBS so that will go away eventually.
    - Moving darktable's main window freezes the application. No idea what's going on
    there. Since I have seen some Windows installations moving the window on startup
    and subsequently freezing automatically it might be impossible to run darktable
    for you.
    - Building with openCL isn't completely done yet (links used for caching). This
    might change soonish, no idea if it would work in the end though.
    - Importing directories didn't work in my tests (freezes), single images imported
    fine though, I could edit them and export them.
    - Lua support doesn't compile right now since it uses select() on a file which is not
    supported on Windows.

    Have fun with this, report back your findings and understand that we don't intend
    to officially support a Windows version, let alone provide binaries for download.
