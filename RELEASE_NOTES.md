## The Big Ones

- The color picker on the blend, tone curve, color zones and fill
  light modules now allows to select an area by ctrl+click on it.

- Add undo/redo support in lighttable for tags, color labels, rating,
  metadata, deleted history stack, pasted history stack and applied
  style.

- A new timeline view has been introduced in the lighttable.

- A new exposé lighttable's mode to be used to compare multiple images.

- A quite extensive rewrite of the lighttable has been made to improve
  drastically the overall performance. This also includes the
  filmstrip which has also see a big rewrite for the same reasons. The
  lighttable is now usable on 4K and 5K monitors.

- Add new raster mask supports. This is a copy of a parametric mask
  which is stable during the whole pixel-pipe.

## New Features And Changes

- A new profile ‘histogram profile’ has been added on the same pop-up
  that the softproof one on the darkroom. It controls the color space
  of the histogram, color picker and overexposed check. When gamut or
  softproof checks are active the histogram and color picker use the
  softproof profile, otherwise they use the histogram profile. The
  overexposed check always use the histogram profile.

- A new color picker has been added to the blend module next to the
  existing one that adjusts the range sliders based on the selected
  area from the image. Click to adjust the input image slider,
  ctrl+click to adjust the out image one.

- The color zones module now display an histogram based on the ‘select
  by’ channel and displays the selected range if the color picker is
  in area mode.

- The picasa module has been renamed to googlephoto and completely
  rewrited to support the new Google Photo API. It is now again
  possible to create albums directly from the export module.

- New module image information which can be positioned at the bottom
  or the top of the darkroom. The information displayed can be changed
  via the preferences. This module can replace the image information
  displayed on the histogram.

- Many code optimizations for CPU and SSE paths.

- A new preference to expand/collapse a darkroom module when it is
  activated/deactivated.

- The collect module supports single click if the corresponding new
  option is activated.

- The collect module supports range selection (for numerics/dates)
  when using single click mode.

- Add option to scatter the search zone in denoise profile non local
  means mode.

- The gradient mask orientation is now clearly displayed by using an
  arrow.

- Add support for theme, and allow to dynamically load theme from the
  preferences.

- The graduatednd module has better accuracy when computing the
  rotation to avoid the gradiant to flip sporadically.

- Make sure the OpenCL kernel code are recompiled when the driver
  version is updated.

- Add color pickers in the split toning module.

- Add color pickers in the graduateddnd module.
