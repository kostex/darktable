## The Big Ones

- A full rework of the GUI Gtk/CSS. The whole GUI is now fully
  controlled by CSS rules. There is no more size, color, position in
  Gtk C code. This makes the whole GUI themable. This version comes
  with different theme:

     - darktable              : the default theme

     - darktable-elegant      : more condensed fonts
                                best experience if Roboto font installed

     - darktable-icons        : as elegant, with IOP icons
                                best experience if Roboto font installed

     - darktable-elegant-grey : as above but grey instead of dark

     - darktable-icons-grey   : as above but grey instead of dark

  Note that this requires Gtk 3.22 or higher to work properly.

- The color picker on the blend, tone curve, color zones and fill
  light modules now allows to select an area by ctrl+click on it.

- Add undo/redo support in lighttable for tags, color labels, rating,
  metadata, deleted history stack, pasted history stack and applied
  style.

  IMPORTANT:
  As ctrl-z is commonly used for undo/redo this is what is used
  on the lighttable. This conflicts with the previous ctrl-z which
  was assigned to preview with focus point. The preview (previously z)
  and preview with focus detection (previously ctrl-z) are now assigned
  respectively to w and ctrl-w.

- A new timeline view has been introduced in the lighttable.

- A new lighttable mode 'culling' is added. It displays a fixed number
  of consecutive images, starting from the first selected image and
  allows to pan & zoom them.  It can be navigated with the mouse wheel
  and keyboard and the number of displayed images can be set with an
  entry at the bottom.

- A quite extensive rewrite of the lighttable has been made to improve
  drastically the overall performance. This also includes the
  filmstrip which has also received a big rewrite for the same reasons. The
  lighttable is now usable on 4K and 5K monitors.

- Add new raster mask supports. This is a copy of a parametric mask
  which is stable during the whole pixel-pipe.

- Modules can now be re-ordered with shift+drag.

- The color zones module now display an histogram based on the ‘select
  by’ channel and displays the selected range if the color picker is
  in area mode.
  It acts now like the tone curve (but horizontal),
  it has two edit modes: edit by area is the former one, if not checked nodes
  can be edited like in the tone curve, delete only works by right-click
  when not in edit area mode.
  A new process mode has been added: smooth is the former one, strong is new.
  An interpolation method has been added that allows to select different types
  of curves.
  The color picker allows to select by area with ctrl+click.
  A new color picker has been added that creates a curve based on the area
  selected from the image.
  When pressing the shortcut 'pan&zoom while editing masks' the draw area
  can now be zoomed. Double-click on the bottom bar resets the zoom.

## New Features And Changes

- A new module for handling 3D Lut transformations (PNG Hald-CLUT and
  Cube files are supported).

- A new profile ‘histogram profile’ has been added on the same pop-up
  that the softproof one on the darkroom. It controls the color space
  of the histogram, color picker and overexposed check. When gamut or
  softproof checks are active the histogram and color picker use the
  softproof profile, otherwise they use the histogram profile. The
  overexposed check always use the histogram profile.

- A new profile 'work profile' has been added to the input color profile
  module. Now RGB modules between the input and output color profile modules
  will work with this profile.

- A new color picker has been added to the blend module next to the
  existing one that adjusts the range sliders based on the selected
  area from the image. Click to adjust the input image slider,
  ctrl+click to adjust the out image one.

- The picasa module has been renamed to googlephoto and completely
  rewrote to support the new Google Photo API. It is now again
  possible to create albums directly from the export module.

- New module image information which can be positioned at the bottom
  or the top of the darkroom. The information displayed can be changed
  via the preferences. This module can replace the image information
  displayed on the histogram.

- Many code optimizations for CPU and SSE paths.

- A new preference to expand/collapse a darkroom module when it is
  activated/deactivated.

- The collect module supports single click if the corresponding new
  option is activated.

- The collect module supports range selection (for numeric/dates)
  when using single click mode.

- Add option to scatter the search zone in denoise profile non local
  means mode.

- The gradient mask orientation is now clearly displayed by using an
  arrow.

- Add support for theme, and allow to dynamically load theme from the
  preferences.

- The graduatednd module has better accuracy when computing the
  rotation to avoid the gradient to flip sporadically.

- Make sure the OpenCL kernel code are recompiled when the driver
  version is updated.

- Add color pickers in the split toning module.

- Add color pickers in the graduateddnd module.

- Add color picker to the watermark module.

- The color picker point positions are kept during the editing on the
  module.

- The map view will zoom on the images of the selected collection.

- The slideshow supports changing the delay between each images.

- The slideshow will now start at the selected pictures if any.

- The slideshow will now be more responsive when changing the picture
  backward and forward.

- Add soft boundaries for denoise profile controls.

- A new module 'basic adjustments' has been added. It allows to adjust
  the exposure, highlight compression, contrast, brightness and saturation.
  It also has an auto feature based on Rawtherapee's auto levels that can
  work on the entire image or a user selected area.
  Both the contrast and the auto feature use the middle grey point, the
  default for this setting is based on the work profile.

- A new module 'rgb curve' has been added. It has linked and
  independent RGB channels.
  It works with the rgb colorspace selected on the work profile.
  The curves and histogram can be displayed using the work profile or
  can be scaled to be 50% grey.
  The color picker allows to select by area with ctrl+click.
  The second color picker add 4 nodes to the curve based on the area
  selected from the image: min, average, middle, max.
  When pressing the shortcut 'pan&zoom while editing masks' the draw area
  can be zoomed.
  Different types of curves can be selected.

- A new module 'rgb levels' has been added. It has linked and
  independent channels, preserve colors option and is native RGB.

- A search text has been added to the module groups in the darkroom. It has a
  config option to show only the modules groups, only the search text or both.
  Modules are searched by name (localized).

  If displaying only the search text, the active pipe modules are
  displayed when the search text is empty.  A darkroom shortcut can be
  set to focus on the search box.

- A preview window has been added to the darkroom that displays the edited image
  on a separate window.

- A new option 'skip' is added to the 'on conflict' setting on the export module
  that skips the export if the file already exists.

- Allow to change algorithm clone/heal and blur/color in retouch module.

## Bug fixes

- The color picker support has been fixed by a complete rewrite. It
  should now gives correct values in all cases.

- Fix overexposed display.

  fixed. This was visible when a liquify mask was used together with
  the perspective correction module activated.

  orientation.

- The modification of date/time is now stored into the XMP. This
  ensure that removing the picture and reloading will keep the change
  made.
